                    All of us were in AP European History and noticed that almost all people in the class had an AP workbook to prepare for the AP Exam. However, after AP testing, many students were indifferent about what happened to their book. We decided to collect some of the students’ AP European History workbooks with the plan of distributing them to those who would benefit from having them.
                    <br>
                    <br> However, instead of staying with just AP European History workbooks, we decided to expand to more AP subjects. This allows us to better fit an individual library’s needs for the AP classes offered in the area. After the collection period, we intend to distribute the books to libraries around the San Francisco Bay Area.

                <h2 class="mb-5">FAQ's</h2>

                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	How will you collect books?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> Collection bins in the Hub/Classrooms, we were wondering if you could help us out with that. We can provide bins or buckets for classes to put their books in, we would ask you to just make an announcement about it. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Why are you running this non-profit?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> To benefit the schools and students around us! </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Is the school sponsoring this?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> No, this is entirely student run by us. We are a registered non-profit. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	How will you get the books to the schools?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> After collecting the books, we’ll inventory them and finalize the schools to distribute to. Then, we’ll drive over to the schools and give them to the school. We’ll let each individual school decide how they want to distribute books to their students. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Where are the books stored?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> As of now, Darion’s house. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Where are you going to be donating the books to?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> Low-Income schools that need AP Prep Books for their students. Their students may not be able to afford these books and need College Board financial assistance for their tests as well. These students are at an inherent disadvantage and we want to address that. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Why should I participate? How can I help?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> We are setting up stations in each of your classrooms that students are free to donate books to at the end of the semester. If you already collect AP Prep books for extra credit, then we are hoping to collaborate and create a system in which we can collect the books that the students turned in if they don’t want them back after a certain period of time. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Why would students donate their books voluntarily?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> Volunteer Hours. We’ll have them write their names on a post in and put it on the book they’re donating. Then, after inventorying them, we’ll give out the hours. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	How many books will you be donating?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> As many as we can provide given your school’s needs </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	What can I do to help?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> We will take care of all the collection and transportation of the books. You just need to decide how the books will be distributed to students. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Are you donating to other schools as well?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> We want to donate to as many schools as possible in order to provide aid efficiently for the most number of Bay Area students </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	How will books be distributed?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> We believe that the individual schools, teachers, and administrators will know the best way to reach their students. Therefore, after we donate the books to the school, we will let each individual school choose their own course of action for distributing the books. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	What’s the benefit?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> The benefit is free AP Prep books for your students at absolutely no cost or any strings attached. </p>
                <h3><span class="text-primary">Q:</span>	Are the books used?	</h3>
                <p class="FAQText"> Yes, they were used by previous students who voluntarily donated their books after their exams. We check each individual books for quality and usability </p>
